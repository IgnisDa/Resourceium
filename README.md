[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/KushagraSinha2002/Resourceium)

the idea behind resource pooling is that through modern scalable systems involved in cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS), providers can create a sense of infinite or immediately available resources by controlling resource adjustments at a meta level. This allows customers to change their levels of service at will without being subject to any of the limitations of physical or virtual resources
