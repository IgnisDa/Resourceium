      ------why resourcium------------ resourcium allows you to store, search,
      and access files with a team. Even if members leave, the files stay in
      place so your team can keep sharing information and work anywhere, from
      any device. The biggest reason for utilizing resourecium is to increase
      the visibility of your content. ------Resetting your password------- To
      change the password for your account when you're already logged in, click
      "your account" in the sidebar. Update your password by clicking the pen
      icon in the Password section , change the passwordand click "update.”
      ------Account Activity--------- To review recent activity on your account,
      go to "dashboard" at the top there are 4 graphs representing your account
      activity. Here you'll find the list of files that you have uploaded over
      the past 7 days. -----Dashboard Preferences------- The "Best First"
      setting gives you an algorithmic dashboard. Your dashboard will show you
      the files resourcium thinks you'll like, rather than just the newest
      content. ------Tagging your posts--------- Tags make it easier for readers
      to find posts about a specific topic on your blog. For instance, you could
      tag your physics notes with #physics or posts about corona with #covid19.
      Tagging your posts is as easy as you’d expect. When you create a post,
      enter the tags in the field at the bottom of the post form ------Update
      Profile------- To update basic profile information like name, username and
      email address you need to go to the "your account" option (10th position
      in the sidebar) then click the option of "Update Account Details".There
      you can update all the information you want to change and then hit the
      "Update button". -------Making a post-------- Ready to share something?
      Good! Nothing is quite so invigorating as a fresh post at the "upload"
      page (2nd position in the sidebar), you can click the option of "new
      folder".There you can add the title, description, and body of the folder
      in which you can upload the desired files. ------groups------- in the
      "groups" page you can create groups with some certain people and the posts
      shared on the particular group will be restricted to the respective
      members of that group. for instance , to share physics resource with few
      people only you can create a group with them and share the resource in
      that group.
